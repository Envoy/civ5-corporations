Minor comment: truffles could get the Burger Shack bonus. Whether you look at them as bacon or 
actual mushrooms, they are a burger option.

Franchises of a corporation that is owned by a player should still cost that player 1 GPT (describe 
in in the mod as "overhead costs"?). Otherwise, the bonuses from having a maintenance-cost-free 
franchise of your corporation(s) in each of your cities very heavily outweigh any costs from the 
initial sinking of production into building the corporation wonder. Also, some franchises are much 
more powerful than others; having +4-6 food in a city from a building lets you take 2-3 workers 
from food and put them onto other non-food tiles. Getting, for example, +2 science from a Think 
Drink franchise in a city with 2 aluminum mines is much less useful than using the Burger Shack 
franchise's food to offset the placement of 2 workers from food tiles into science-specialization 
slots (which yields +6-8 science in the presence of the social policies you'd take anyways, as 
well as Great Scientist points).

I am happy that you have done a big effort to bring something new to Civilization V, and that is 
why I thank you Envoy. Altrough I don't understand these food corporation, why would not combine 
burgers and drinks, and reaname it to fastfoodchain corporation. It could boost food per city,or 
you would get some happines bonuses from some bonus resources (Cow,Deer and wheat), but this is just my opinion. 
What I realy want to have is Oil Corporation, Airplain corporaiton and Steel corporaiton. 
Oil.C could produce oil,consume it, or give bonuses to oil strategic resource. 
Airplaine.C would consume oil (2-5 maybe?), you would get bonuses from natural wonders and world wonders,because of turists.Bonuses could be culture,gold or happines.
Steel.C would do iron more usefull resource, that means Steel.C could transform/consume iron to production or gold.
Just some ideas that raised in my head.

1. Unlock the ability to construct the various Corporation wonders to all civilizations at the start of the Industrial era, with the first player to enter it gaining a 15% production bonus for those wonders.

2. Give a small (5-10%?) bonus to constructing a Corporation wonder for each resource it uses that the city has access to.

This is looking great! I haven't tried it yet but I can already come up with a two suggestions to 
improve it. First the corporation wonders themselves should not give a massive gold bonus on their
 own, after all it's an investment and one can expect massive amount of revenue from the franchises. 
 Maybe they should provide no additional gold bonus or even gold penalty. This would make the 
 decision to build these corporations more strategic. Second, as someone has already said, the 
 reward the corporation owner gets from each franchises should be slightly lower than the building 
 maintenance to reflect cost. Finally, thanks for the great mod!
